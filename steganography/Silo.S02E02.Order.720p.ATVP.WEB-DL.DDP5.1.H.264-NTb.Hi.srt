00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:06,924
[Juliette panting]

00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,815
[gasps]

3
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,025
[grunts, groans]

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,152
Stop.

5
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,587
[alarm blaring]

6
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,564
[alarm continues blaring]

7
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,275
[grunts]

8
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,534
[grunts, sniffs]

9
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,380
[groans]

10
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,558
Carl?

11
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,938
[citizens clamoring]

12
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,941
Please stay inside, Your Honor.

13
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:49,901
What's going on?

14
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,486
The sheriff didn't clean, ma'am.

15
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:59,411
[automated voice] <i>Return to your homes
as quickly and quietly as possible.</i>

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,706
<i>Your safety is our only concern.</i>

17
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,503
<i>Return to your homes as quickly
and quietly as possible.</i>

18
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,673
<i>Your safety is our only concern.</i>

19
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,887
<i>Return to your homes as quickly
and quietly as possible.</i>

20
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,222
Nichols went over the hill.

21
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,848
- I know.
- I couldn't find you.

22
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,099
I called in the alarm.

23
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,185
Scrambled the off-duty
and the reserved raiders.

24
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,523
Good. Announce an 8:00
p.m. emergency curfew,

25
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,525
putting the sheriff's
deputies under your command.

26
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,068
I also need eyes on
Nichols's father.

27
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,486
Don't harass him.

28
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,072
Just see who he's talking
to and who talks to him.

29
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,491
Sending Nichols out to clean
was supposed to prevent this.

30
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,243
I will be making a
speech later today.

31
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,702
Do you hear what's going on?

32
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,205
People are saying it's
time for another rebellion.

33
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,207
That's why they need to
know what happened today.

34
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,542
It's under investigation.

35
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,252
We're talking to everyone
who knew Nichols.

36
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:50,546
I know what happened.

37
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,464
There are two people in the
Down Deep I need detained.

38
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,550
Take them into custody.

39
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,093
Bet they're loving
this down there.

40
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,595
- [citizens clamoring]
- [Hank] Hey!

41
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,849
People, let's calm down.

42
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,645
Let's calm down. Please. Quiet.

43
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,980
Listen to me.

44
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,399
[automated voice] <i>Return to your
homes as quickly and quietly...</i>

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,901
No, you can't cut off
official announcements!

46
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,902
<i>Your safety is our...</i>

47
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,987
[citizens cheering]

48
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,282
Hey! No. Come on, move it out.

49
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,324
Come on.

50
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,617
I don't make the rules.

51
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,995
[citizen 1] Hank, fuck you!

52
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,788
I just watched, the same as you.

53
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,040
She walked over the hill.

54
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,835
- That means it's safe.
- [citizens murmuring]

55
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,628
- I wanna go out too.
- [citizens clamoring]

56
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,755
Don't say that.
You can't say that.

57
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,050
Please calm down.
You can't say that.

58
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,177
[Knox] Move.

59
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:43,556
Hank, give it up.

60
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,975
- You're in over your head.
- [citizens] Yes!

61
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,644
You need to shut the fuck up
and listen to these people.

62
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,562
[citizens] Yes!

63
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,523
- We got a right to ask questions.
- [citizens] Yes!

64
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,525
- Don't we?
- [citizens] Yes!

65
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,821
We just saw something no
one has ever seen before.

66
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,490
- And we all want to know what that means.
- [citizens] Yes.

67
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,869
Juliette Nichols
was one of our own.

68
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,039
Then why'd you turn her in?

69
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,382
I did.

70
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,226
Jules is like family to me,
but I had to make a choice.

71
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:30,896
They knew she was here.

72
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,148
They'd have torn
our homes apart.

73
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,026
They're just looking
for an excuse.

74
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,029
They think we're dumb animals.
We have to show them...

75
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,658
They'll think different after we cut
off the power and shut down the Silo.

76
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,785
- [citizen 2] Yes!
- [clamoring]

77
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:46,954
Once!

78
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,832
We can shut the Silo down once.

79
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,000
And then they'll crush us.

80
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,003
We all saw Jules
walk over the hill.

81
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,214
We're not gonna listen to lies
anymore. We want the truth.

82
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,884
[clamoring]

83
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,553
[Knox] Listen to me!

84
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,554
Listen.

85
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,973
[water spraying]

86
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,809
[citizens gasping, groaning]

87
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,487
Most of us got jobs to
get back to, don't we?

88
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,782
[citizens coughing, murmuring]

89
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,662
[Knox] You gotta stop.

90
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,956
This place is a tinderbox.

91
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,457
Is that an order?

92
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,585
Yes.

93
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,941
[Alice] Doctor?

94
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,901
Dr. Nichols?

95
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,408
The Anderson baby
won't stop crying.

96
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,668
[baby crying]

97
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,214
[Pete] How'd you do
this, little one?

98
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:45,924
[Alice] What?

99
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,468
[Pete] She dislocated her elbow.

100
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,889
[baby continues crying]

101
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,682
There you go.

102
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,559
All done.

103
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,645
Do you want me to...

104
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,439
Poor little girl.

105
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:02,983
[grunts]

106
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,736
- [crying stops]
- [sighs]

107
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,238
[babbling]

108
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,159
Poor little girl.

109
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,334
You're serious.

110
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,586
The Sheriff's Department
reports to you?

111
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,923
For now. It's only
temporary, Paul.

112
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,549
And we're getting the sheriff's
apartment cleaned out.

113
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,762
Bernard wants you and your family to
move in there as soon as possible.

114
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,639
He wants things to
get back to normal.

115
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,517
She walked over the hill.

116
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,227
How are things
going to be normal?

117
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,441
By us. All of us acting
coolly and calmly.

118
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,410
Are there any other parts of the
Pact Bernard plans on ignoring?

119
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,662
[Sims] Paul, this
is an emergency.

120
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,122
Am I still supposed to write my
report on Nichols's cleaning?

121
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,208
Of course.

122
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,921
I still haven't
gotten your statement.

123
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,925
Nichols saying she
wanted to go out.

124
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,227
All right, here's my statement.

125
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,190
Bernard believed Nichols was
in violation of our relic laws.

126
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,151
He led her to the cornfield to
keep her arrest non-disruptive.

127
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,071
Once he confronted her about the
red-level relic in her possession...

128
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,489
A relic he later destroyed.

129
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,617
For the safety of the Silo.

130
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:40,789
Once he confronted her, which I observed,
Nichols said she wanted to go out.

131
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,875
As raiders came in to
apprehend her, she ran.

132
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,543
They chased her and caught her.

133
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,669
End of statement.

134
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,754
That do it?

135
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,508
[Paul] One thing.

136
00:09:54,344 --> 00:10:00,100
If Nichols just said she wanted
to go out, why did she run?

137
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:02,977
I don't know.

138
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,647
She must have changed her mind.

139
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,947
What if she's still alive?

140
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,577
[sighs] We can't just sit here when
she might still be out there somewhere.

141
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,871
She's not alive.

142
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,166
There's only so much
air in that suit.

143
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,795
What was the note you
had me deliver to her?

144
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,006
I figured you'd read it.

145
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,800
Of course, I read it. I... I
just... I didn't understand it.

146
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,261
You weren't supposed to.

147
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,681
Just a private joke
between me and my girl.

148
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,726
You said they're good in supply.

149
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,019
Is that about the tape?

150
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,482
[inhales sharply] Why don't you leave
me alone to feel like shit for a while?

151
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,614
I'm sorry, Walk.

152
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,283
But...

153
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,037
it's not enough to just mourn.

154
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,499
[knocking]

155
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,631
Hey, Shirl.

156
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,219
[sighs] What do you want?

157
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,514
I need to talk to Walker alone.

158
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,728
Go on.

159
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,199
How you doing?

160
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,493
How the hell do you
think I'm doing?

161
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,746
Yeah. Yeah, dumb
question. Sorry.

162
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,747
Look...

163
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,417
I'm sorry, Walker.

164
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,171
But Judicial Security has some
questions they want to ask you.

165
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,798
They know where to find me.

166
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,468
I'm, uh, supposed to
take you into custody.

167
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,304
Sheriff's Department
works for Judicial now?

168
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,348
As of an hour ago. Yes.

169
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,268
You gotta come with me, Walk...

170
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,353
And, uh...

171
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,648
I need to make it look good.

172
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,734
[scoffs]

173
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,735
[Meadows] It's not possible.

174
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,071
They all say they won't
clean and they all do.

175
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,865
Your Honor, I saw it.

176
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:24,203
She... She held out the cleaning
pad and then she just dropped it.

177
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:29,124
- But then it got...
- What? Did she decide not to die too?

178
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,420
She walked over the hill.

179
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,166
[Meadows] I don't believe you.

180
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,386
Everybody saw it.

181
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,016
Go, please.

182
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,440
[door opens]

183
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,109
[door closes]

184
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,029
What now, Bernard?

185
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,299
[breathes sharply]

186
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:37,526
I thought we told you scum from
Mechanical to stay out of here.

187
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,490
Good to see you,
you son of a bitch.

188
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,576
I missed you.

189
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,911
Heard some crazy shit
about your shadow.

190
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,913
They must be pissed off up top.

191
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,791
[Knox] Yeah, they're
coming down on everybody.

192
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,122
[disabled worker] Fuck 'em.

193
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,671
They need us more
than we need them.

194
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,592
[Knox] Feels
different this time.

195
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,221
Yeah, it does. But
you'll handle it.

196
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,557
You're your old man's son.

197
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,061
Sometimes I'm not sure if that's
a good thing or a bad thing.

198
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,398
Trust me, it's a good thing.

199
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,488
Hadn't been for him, I'd
never have made it out.

200
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:28,660
I need some help.

201
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,205
Okay. If I can.

202
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,373
I got two asks.

203
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,960
If anybody comes to you and
wants you to make weapons, don't.

204
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,461
It's too dangerous.

205
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,136
What's the second ask?

206
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,477
[knocking]

207
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,647
[Bernard breathes deeply]

208
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,234
You must know why I'm here.

209
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,611
More or less.

210
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,033
[sighs]

211
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,541
[Bernard breathes deeply]

212
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,881
I'd make you a drink, but I
don't want you to stay that long.

213
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:26,217
Understood.

214
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:29,136
Uh, feel free to have one
yourself, if you like.

215
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,222
I stopped.

216
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,475
You stopped?

217
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,059
[Meadows] Mm-hmm.

218
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,104
Hmm. When?

219
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:39,522
Today.

220
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,568
Oh. [scoffs]

221
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:48,698
[inhales sharply] I'm speaking
to the Silo this evening

222
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,909
and I would like
you to be behind me.

223
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,079
Behind you?

224
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,332
As a show of unity, to
reassure the people.

225
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:00,248
But you're not ordering me.

226
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:05,631
Well, with the lives of
10,000 people at risk,

227
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,342
I didn't think I'd
have to order you.

228
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:14,683
I came here myself to
ask, out of respect.

229
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,603
Do you know how she
got over the hill?

230
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,646
It had to be the tape.

231
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,941
Someone was gonna figure
that out sooner or later.

232
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,904
My mistake was not sending Nichols
to the mines when she stole it.

233
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:28,654
[breathes sharply]

234
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,157
You're frightened.

235
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,327
Well, no one knows
me better than you.

236
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,246
[Meadows] So, do you
imagine that an angry mob

237
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,291
is gonna break down the
door and kill us all?

238
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,045
I'm not afraid of what I imagine,
I'm afraid of what I saw.

239
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,089
What she saw. On the
other side of that hill.

240
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,591
Thousands and
thousands of bodies.

241
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,135
An entire silo dead.

242
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,346
It looked like the Silo
went to war with itself.

243
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,639
That's what scares me.

244
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Because if it happened
there, it could happen here.

245
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,394
Your beloved <i>Order</i>
lays out the protocols.

246
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,771
For what to do if
someone fails to clean.

247
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,940
But <i>The Order</i> doesn't say
anything about what to do

248
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,943
if someone walks out
of fucking sight.

249
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,779
The Founders never imagined it or
wouldn't admit it was possible.

250
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,282
But today it happened, and the
entire Silo watched it happen.

251
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,492
So, what are you gonna do?

252
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,704
Well, that's what I'm here
for, to figure it out.

253
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, I can't help you.

254
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,127
[Bernard] You were my shadow.

255
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,132
- And then I wasn't.
- [Bernard] This is an emergency.

256
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,180
[scoffs]

257
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,433
I'll never fucking
understand you.

258
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,060
What was it, Mary?

259
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,230
Twenty-five years of a secret.

260
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,066
What are you holding on to?

261
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,319
What aren't you telling me?

262
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:52,197
You're hiding something.

263
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,118
Well, I need your help and, uh,

264
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,703
if you're not willing to
do it for old times' sake

265
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:00,622
and you're not willing
to do it for the Silo,

266
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,083
then what is it
you fucking want?

267
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,918
More living space?

268
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:06,962
The pick of the relics?

269
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,380
A bigger staff? What
the fuck do you want?

270
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,842
[sighs] You still
don't know me, do you?

271
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,095
All right then. I'll tell
you what I'll settle for.

272
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:25,898
[Meadows] In this story, there
is an all-powerful wizard

273
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,859
who no one ever sees.

274
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,654
And when they do, he
turns out to be a fraud...

275
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,115
hiding behind a handful
of cheap tricks.

276
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,116
So I'm a fraud?

277
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,871
No, I am.

278
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:47,711
And at the end of the story, he gets
into a hot-air balloon and he flies away.

279
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,256
That's what I want.

280
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,676
Can you do that for me?

281
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,554
Because if you can,
well, then I'll help you.

282
00:18:58,764 --> 00:18:59,765
But if you can't...

283
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,976
well, then fuck off.

284
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,066
[citizens chattering]

285
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:41,056
I hate to do this to you, but...
[sighs] ...I gotta lock you up.

286
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:46,185
What in hell's going on, Hank? Since
when do you lock up old ladies?

287
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,815
Since I got orders to hold you
both for questioning by Judicial.

288
00:19:56,947 --> 00:20:00,284
You need anything, holler
until somebody comes.

289
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,204
Where are you going?

290
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,455
[Hank] Oh, we gotta go make sure

291
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,667
everybody's out to hear
the mayor's speech.

292
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:12,003
First they want them all
staying inside their apartments,

293
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,839
now they want 'em outside.

294
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,258
Come on. Here, let's go.

295
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,684
So, what did you tell 'em?

296
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,562
Not a damn thing.

297
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,772
I thought you said something.

298
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,608
You know me better than that.

299
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,036
Hank locked her in the
deputy station holding cell.

300
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,454
McLain's there too.

301
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:47,915
It's gotta be about the tape.

302
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,875
The IT tape Jules
stole was shit, right?

303
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:55,088
I think Walker and McLain must have
switched it out with our heat tape.

304
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:59,050
Wait, wait, you think Judicial
knew the suit tape didn't work?

305
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,676
[Shirley] They had to.

306
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:04,890
If we can get to Walk, find out
what she knows, we'll have proof.

307
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:08,309
But why would people believe
Walker instead of Judicial?

308
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,271
Because they just saw
Juliette walk over the hill.

309
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,778
- [Martha] The deal is...
- I have a plan.

310
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,198
Judicial may suspect we did it
but they can't know for sure.

311
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,909
Not about you.

312
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,119
But that tape comes
right back to me.

313
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,996
- Maybe. But...
- [Carla] No buts.

314
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:33,334
Juliette came to me, begged
me to switch the tape.

315
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,836
You had nothing to do with it.

316
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,838
[Martha] No, no. Hell with that.

317
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,756
We keep our mouths shut,

318
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:41,092
make them tell us what
they think happened.

319
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,427
Then we deny everything.

320
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,470
They know it was the tape.

321
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,752
[Martha] We're the only two
people who know that for sure.

322
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,767
Keep our mouths shut. We got
a chance to brass it out.

323
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,769
You old fool.

324
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,689
They don't need us to
tell them anything.

325
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,608
They'll find some
lowlife to denounce us

326
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:01,905
and send us both to the
mines or out to clean.

327
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,579
The only chance we got to box
'em in, is for me to cop to it.

328
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,791
I'm damned if I'm gonna watch them
punish you for something I started.

329
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,877
Then they'll kill us both.

330
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:18,755
That's gonna happen,
sooner or later.

331
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,301
Least this way, we
get to go together.

332
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:53,624
[Bernard clears throat]

333
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:59,003
I know many of you
are feeling uncertain

334
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:02,883
or unsettled by what
you saw earlier today.

335
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:10,474
But I am here to tell you
that today was a good day.

336
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:16,188
Today was the first
day of a new era.

337
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,942
For as long as we can remember,

338
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:24,947
everyone that went out to
clean, died on that hillside.

339
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:29,660
Killed by the dangerous
toxins of an unsafe world.

340
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,330
But today, that changed.

341
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:38,042
Sheriff Nichols asked to go out.

342
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:39,962
Sheriff Nichols went out.

343
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,549
She chose not to clean.

344
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,679
- She's a traitor.
- No, she was not a traitor.

345
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:51,974
Juliette Nichols was a fighter.

346
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:57,646
I disagreed with her about many
things, but I respected her.

347
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:01,357
And never more so
than I did today.

348
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,901
She's alive.

349
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,362
No.

350
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,949
No. I wish that were true...

351
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:12,494
I really wish it were.

352
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:21,544
But she died a hero to the Silo.

353
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:24,256
- [crowd murmuring]
- It's impossible.

354
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,428
Do you all want to listen
to these gentlemen yell?

355
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,056
Or do you want to hear
why Juliette was a hero?

356
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:37,059
[murmuring continues]

357
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,395
Before she went out...

358
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:43,192
I asked Sheriff Nichols

359
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,694
if we could seal her suit
with a new kind of tape.

360
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:51,991
A tape recently developed by
our brilliant suit technicians.

361
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,535
And she...

362
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,247
she courageously agreed.

363
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,377
Her trip over that hill

364
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:08,591
proved that our new tape
provided better protection

365
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,052
against the dangers outside.

366
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:17,053
And that is the first step
forward in our lifetime.

367
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,812
[cheering, applauding]

368
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,818
And we are not finished.

369
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:32,574
We will keep finding ways to make
our suits better and stronger.

370
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:39,163
And to produce tape that may
someday protect all of us

371
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:40,749
from the dangers outside

372
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:47,416
and bring us closer to our ultimate
goal of safely leaving the Silo.

373
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,676
[cheering, applauding]

374
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:06,191
I'd like to thank the mayor for
this exemplary new development,

375
00:26:06,859 --> 00:26:12,363
and commend him for
his decisive leadership

376
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:14,031
at this critical time.

377
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,283
[crowd murmuring]

378
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:20,162
[Meadows] I hereby decree, by the
powers given to me by the Pact,

379
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:24,208
five credits be bestowed
upon every household

380
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,836
to celebrate this
great achievement.

381
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:28,504
[crowd cheering, applauding]

382
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:33,342
[Meadows] We can only hope that
this new tape will lead to a new day

383
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,720
for each and every one of us.

384
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,139
They're lying.

385
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:43,728
Juliette discovered that IT
was using bad tape on purpose.

386
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:48,065
This isn't new tape, this
is the good tape we use.

387
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:53,738
And they didn't plan to use it, someone
from Mechanical switched the tape.

388
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:56,491
- The mayor's lying.
- [raider] Hey!

389
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,952
- What's your name?
- Juliette Nichols.

390
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:02,872
[citizens cheering, applauding]

391
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,125
- Come with me.
- [Knox] What's the problem?

392
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,961
- She's one of my people.
- [raider] She's under arrest.

393
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,381
- You need to step back.
- Oof, whoa.

394
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:14,927
This your first time below 120?

395
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:18,639
I'm Knox.

396
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,227
I can promise you, she's
not a troublemaker.

397
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:25,521
She's just having a bad day.

398
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:29,816
She lost a friend and
she's been drinking,

399
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,903
but she's one of the
best techs in the Silo.

400
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,821
This deputy will vouch for her.

401
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:36,990
Hank?

402
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,787
I'm trying to explain how I can't
afford to lose Shirley right now.

403
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,790
Yeah, we'll keep an eye on her.

404
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,543
She'll be home before curfew.

405
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,756
[raider] That mouth of hers
will get her sent to the mines.

406
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:01,306
[Knox] Thank you. I owe you.

407
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:03,183
I'd say you both do.

408
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:11,899
Come on. We need to talk.

409
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,236
We have nothing to talk about.

410
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,116
Fuck.

411
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:21,952
Follow her.

412
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:32,628
We, uh, threw in a couple of extra
lines, just to make it look real.

413
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,672
And you've been
paid fairly for it.

414
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:36,758
You need us again,
you say the word.

415
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,720
Until I do, keep
your mouths shut.

416
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,848
Or you won't just go
back to detention.

417
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,157
Okay, I took care
of the hecklers.

418
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,825
They were good, by the way.

419
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,036
Nice job.

420
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:05,579
[Sims] Thanks.

421
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,123
Do you know what it is?

422
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,334
I do.

423
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:12,293
Was it important?

424
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:14,796
No, but it is now.

425
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:19,134
What's the mood like out
there? Any incidents?

426
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,553
[Sims] People are back in their
homes. No violence reported.

427
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,639
Deputies are all with us.

428
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,100
Watchers have eyes on
known troublemakers.

429
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,019
You turned it around.

430
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:31,480
For now.

431
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:33,898
[Sims] You know you don't
have to do this alone.

432
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,776
If I was your shadow, I could
make sure we would be okay and...

433
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,320
The speech bought
us a day, maybe two.

434
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:42,240
Crisis is not over. I need
you right where you are.

435
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,992
Now, I'd better go.

436
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:47,412
Wouldn't wanna
violate my own curfew.

437
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:01,802
I didn't forget about you.

438
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:05,681
Sorry you had to miss
the mayor's speech.

439
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,266
[inhales heavily]

440
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:11,228
- You...
- [lock clanging]

441
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:14,648
are free to go.

442
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,068
You got 30 minutes
till curfew. Go on.

443
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:21,904
You said Judicial had questions.

444
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:24,782
[Hank] Yeah. They had questions
earlier, and now they don't.

445
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:27,953
At least the mayor explained how
Juliette walked over the hill.

446
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,204
What'd he say?

447
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,624
[Hank] It's a new kind of
tape IT just came up with.

448
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:36,670
Come on.

449
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:39,840
Thank you.

450
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:45,136
- [raider 1] Mr. Mayor.
- [raider 2] Mr. Mayor.

451
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:46,722
Thank you for your service.

452
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:18,795
Sorry I'm late.

453
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:20,546
Anthony asleep?

454
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,006
Mm-hmm.

455
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,050
Yeah, he asked where you were.

456
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:26,386
I said, "I guess Daddy
doesn't love us anymore."

457
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:29,473
Honey, I'm kidding.

458
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:33,601
Sorry. I'm so tired I'm punchy,

459
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:36,355
and it's gonna be like this
till the emergency's over.

460
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:39,399
Here.

461
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,239
I'll heat up your dinner.

462
00:31:46,198 --> 00:31:47,282
Thanks.

463
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,371
Did you have a chance
to talk to Bernard?

464
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:57,834
I asked him straight-out, and he
said I was too valuable where I was.

465
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,169
At least for now.

466
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:03,131
The man needs a shadow.

467
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:04,924
Even if it's not me.

468
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:06,968
We both know it should be you.

469
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,386
It has to be you.

470
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:10,222
What is he waiting for?

471
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,560
I'm trying to figure that out.

472
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,937
[Camille] Did you know Meadows
was gonna be there today?

473
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,064
I didn't.

474
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,818
And nobody's been able to
tell me why she was there.

475
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:25,904
Hmm.

476
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:29,157
I can't remember the last
time she made an appearance.

477
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,451
Sure caused a big stir.

478
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:36,831
Did you work with her
when you were in Judicial?

479
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,418
[scoffs] She didn't
even know I was alive.

480
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:43,380
But they said she was in IT
before she moved to Judicial.

481
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:47,467
Did Meadows and Bernard
know each other back then?

482
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:49,927
[Camille] Yeah, possibly.

483
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:52,346
He was already head of IT. Why?

484
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,807
[Sims] I told Bernard he didn't
have to handle this alone,

485
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:57,060
and he didn't seem concerned.

486
00:32:57,686 --> 00:33:00,731
Which makes me think maybe
he wasn't handling it alone.

487
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:04,109
You think h-he's
talking to Meadows?

488
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:07,154
[clicks tongue] I don't know.

489
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:11,450
There was something about the
way he looked at her today.

490
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,293
You're still full of surprises.

491
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:23,921
Come in.

492
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:34,264
Thank you for your endorsement.

493
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:37,893
What changed your mind?

494
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,647
To be honest, I went
there to watch you fail.

495
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:44,358
To watch it all fall
down around you.

496
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:46,401
And?

497
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:48,903
[inhales deeply]

498
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:51,490
I never thought you had
any talent for politics.

499
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:55,911
But in light of
today's performance,

500
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:58,664
I could be wrong.

501
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:02,125
[scoffs] I wasn't bad, was I?

502
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:06,128
- I assume the hecklers were arranged for?
- [inhales deeply]

503
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:09,381
Yeah, you don't wanna leave
anything like that to chance.

504
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:12,219
And I think the
cover story works.

505
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,637
[Meadows scoffs] Works?

506
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:16,223
It's ludicrous.

507
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:20,185
But given the situation, it
does what you need it to do.

508
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,022
I approached it
like an equation.

509
00:34:25,315 --> 00:34:29,360
[stammers] People saw a miracle happen,
and if I tried to tell them it didn't,

510
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,613
some would buy it but
the mob saw what it saw.

511
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:36,868
So, I gave them a story to explain
the two different kinds of tape.

512
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:39,995
Now, if anyone tries to
tell a different story,

513
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:42,205
then they have to disprove mine.

514
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:46,210
[inhales deeply] And
if that doesn't work,

515
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:49,005
there's always brute force.

516
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,384
Mm-hmm.

517
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:56,596
Brute force works
for a while, but...

518
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,098
But what?

519
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,852
You need to give them
something to believe in.

520
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,313
That is why I need you.

521
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:06,981
[Meadows] You don't need me.

522
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:08,774
You proved that today.

523
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:12,821
On my way up here, I saw the
same new graffiti three times.

524
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,574
"JL."

525
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:17,743
And that was up here.

526
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,746
Who knows what's happening
in the Down Deep?

527
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:23,206
The speech bought us a few days,

528
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:26,752
but I can't manage this
crisis without you.

529
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,213
Because I'm the only other
person who's been in that vault.

530
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:33,717
Because you're the only other
person that I will listen to.

531
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,095
I tried to find
another shadow, but...

532
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:40,765
[sighs]

533
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,351
You set the bar too high.

534
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,228
Listen, when I asked
for your help earlier,

535
00:35:45,229 --> 00:35:48,815
I offered you incentives
and bribes, and I...

536
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:52,611
I realize that was insulting.

537
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,738
And patronizing.

538
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:57,324
And I, uh...

539
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,953
I-I... I apologize.

540
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,458
Thank you.

541
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,132
I want you to see something.

542
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:18,344
[Shirley] We use hand
signals to communicate.

543
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:21,722
If people from the Mids join us,
we'll teach them how it works.

544
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:22,808
[metal clangs]

545
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,352
Hey!

546
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,981
Come into the light, or
we'll come drag you in.

547
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,692
It's me.

548
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:35,195
What are you doing here, Cooper?

549
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:41,743
Knox told me to follow you.

550
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,453
A fucking spy, Coop?

551
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:46,330
I figured as much.

552
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:49,543
Well, go tell him what you
saw, what we talked about.

553
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,545
He can't stop us.

554
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:54,298
I'm gonna tell him you
were home by curfew.

555
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:57,134
All of you were.

556
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,219
Why would you do that?

557
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,055
Because I was Juliette's shadow.

558
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,058
It was just us two in the generator
room when everything was going to shit.

559
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,811
We'd be dead if it
hadn't been for her.

560
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,481
So I'm not here for Knox.

561
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:14,943
I'm here for Juliette.

562
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,738
And whatever you guys
are doing, I want in.

563
00:37:25,204 --> 00:37:26,205
[sighs]

564
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:31,626
Bernard's story about
the tape was a lie.

565
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:33,794
I know that Walker switched
the tape because she sent a...

566
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,214
[Martha] You don't
know shit, girl.

567
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:42,053
You keep saying stuff like that,
we'll all be sent to the mines.

568
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:43,972
They've got eyes
and ears everywhere.

569
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:48,017
How did you find us?

570
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:50,062
I followed this mastermind.

571
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:54,232
None of you are cut out
for this kind of thing.

572
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:58,277
You're no good at it. So, quit talking
about the tape and Juliette and all.

573
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:00,572
It's hazardous for your health.

574
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:04,742
Are you with us?

575
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,537
What are you aiming to do?

576
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:08,746
Find people like us.

577
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,623
People who think like us.

578
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:13,293
Who know they're being lied
to, and wanna know the truth.

579
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,838
When there's enough
of you, what then?

580
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,464
We demand answers.

581
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:22,009
Yeah, you won't get answers.

582
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,302
Then we fight.

583
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:24,930
[Martha] They're ready for that.

584
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:28,851
You've seen all the raiders
and deputies out there.

585
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,561
They're just waiting for one
of you to make the first move.

586
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:34,313
- They've got all the weapons.
- Well, maybe some of the raiders

587
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:37,192
and deputies will decide they
wanna know the truth too.

588
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:39,319
M-Maybe.

589
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:44,448
Little while ago, I heard on the
radio there's some new graffiti

590
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,326
growing up all over the Silo.

591
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:48,871
"JL."

592
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:51,957
Juliette lives.

593
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:55,002
[Shirley] Good.

594
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:57,629
Good, because I think it's true.

595
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,590
I think she's alive.

596
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,551
What do you think, Walk?

597
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:07,264
Well, with all of you guys dedicated
to finding out the truth, yeah.

598
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:11,018
She's alive.

599
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:29,953
For the first time in 25
years, I don't wanna be drunk.

600
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:34,750
I wanna be as clear-headed
as I can about this.

601
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:38,170
And you going forward.

602
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:42,256
I'll help you, Bernard.

603
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:43,966
Thank you. I know
that together...

604
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:47,011
First, let me tell you
what you have to do for me.

605
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:48,680
I'll give you whatever you ask.

606
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:53,352
Then get me some of the good tape, and
put it aside until the crisis is over.

607
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,061
Why?

608
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:57,940
I want my freedom.

609
00:39:58,774 --> 00:39:59,899
I don't know what...

610
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,069
You couldn't get me the
wizard's hot-air balloon,

611
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,783
so I want what Juliette
Nichols had today.

612
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:12,663
I want to go out.
